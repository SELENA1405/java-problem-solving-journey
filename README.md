# Java Problem Solving Journey 
This repository contains my Java solutions to various problem-solving exercises as part of my learning journey in programming and software engineering.

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Practice **Java fundamentals** through consistent problem-solving
- Improve **logical thinking and problem decomposition**
- Reinforce concepts by applying them to small, focused problems
- Build confidence in writing clean and understandable Java code

This repository reflects my current learning stage, and solutions may be improved or refactored as I progress.

---

## Problem Source
- **CodingBat (Java section)**

All problems in this repository are sourced from CodingBat and are solved as practice exercises.

---

## Topics Covered
This repository covers all topics included in **CodingBat (Java)**, such as:
- Variables and data types
- Conditionals (if/else)
- Loops
- Arrays
- Strings
- Methods
- Basic recursion
- Introductory problem-solving patterns

---

## Learning Approach
- Focus on writing solutions that I **fully understand**
- Prioritize **clarity and correctness** over optimization
- Use problem-solving as a way to strengthen core concepts
- Revisit and improve solutions as my understanding grows

---

## Notes
This repository is intended for learning and practice.  
Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
